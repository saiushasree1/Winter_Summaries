This C++ code solves a problem from Codeforces (specifically, problem 2014C). It reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` long long integers. It calculates the sum of the elements in `a` and stores it in `tot`. The array `a` is then sorted in ascending order.

The code handles the cases where `n` is 1 or 2 separately, printing -1. For `n > 2`, it finds the middle element at index `n/2`. It then compares `2 * a[n/2] * n` with `tot`.

- If `2 * a[n/2] * n < tot`, it prints 0.
- Otherwise, it performs a calculation based on the values of `2 * a[n/2] * n`, `tot`, and `n`. Based on the result of this calculation, it prints either `(2 * a[n/2] * n - tot) + 1` or `(2 * a[n/2] * n - tot)`.

In essence, the code appears to be calculating some value related to the median element and the sum of the array, likely to determine a quantity based on whether a certain condition involving the median and sum is met. The specific problem being solved and the exact meaning of the output depend on the context of the Codeforces problem 2014C.
