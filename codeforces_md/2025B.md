The code reads an integer `t`, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an array `a` of size `t`. It then determines the maximum value in `a`. It pre-computes powers of 2 modulo 1e9+7 up to this maximum value and stores them in a vector `d`. Finally, for each element `a[i]`, it outputs the corresponding pre-computed power of 2, which is `d[a[i]]`. In essence, the code calculates 2 raised to the power of each element in the input array modulo 1e9+7.
