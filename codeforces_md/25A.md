This C++ code snippet solves the "IQ test" problem from Codeforces (problem 25A). The problem asks you to find the index of the number that is different from the rest in terms of parity (even or odd).

Here's a breakdown:

**Functionality:**

1. Reads an integer `n`, representing the number of elements in an array.
2. Reads `n` integers into an array `a`.
3. Counts the number of odd (`odc`) and even (`evc`) numbers and stores the index (1-based) of the last encountered odd (`odi`) and even (`evi`) number.
4. Determines if there is exactly one odd number or exactly one even number.
5. Prints the 1-based index of the number that has a different parity than the majority.

**Structure:**

- The code is organized into a `solve()` function which encapsulates the core logic.
- The `main()` function simply calls `solve()`.

**Important Details:**

- The code uses a single loop to read the input and determine the counts and last indices of odd and even numbers.
- It assumes that there will always be either exactly one odd number or exactly one even number in the input, based on the problem constraints.
- The indices are 1-based as required by the problem output.

In essence, the code efficiently identifies the number with a different parity by counting the occurrences of odd and even numbers and then printing the index of the number belonging to the minority group.
