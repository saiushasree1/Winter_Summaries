This C++ code solves a problem where you are given two grids of digits and need to determine if the second grid can be obtained from the first grid by applying a specific operation. The operation involves selecting a 2x2 subgrid and incrementing each of its cells modulo 3.

The core logic of the solution is based on the observation that the sum of the digits in each row and each column modulo 3 remains invariant under the allowed operation. Therefore, the code calculates the sum of digits modulo 3 for each row and each column in both grids.

It then compares these sums. If the sums of digits modulo 3 for all corresponding rows and columns are equal between the two grids, the code outputs "YES", indicating that the second grid *could* potentially be obtained from the first. Otherwise, it outputs "NO".

**Key Details:**

* **Input:** The code takes two grids of digits as input, each of size `n x m`.
* **Operation Invariance:** The solution leverages the invariant property of row and column sums modulo 3 under the given operation.
* **Modulo 3 Arithmetic:** All sums are calculated and compared modulo 3.
* **Efficiency:** The approach involves iterating through the grids once to calculate the sums, making it an efficient solution.
* **Assumption:** The problem statement (linked in the code) implicitly suggests that this invariant is a sufficient condition.

In essence, the code checks a necessary condition (invariance of row and column sums modulo 3) to determine the possibility of transforming one grid into the other. While not explicitly proven in the code snippet, this condition is sufficient for the problem as posed on the linked Codeforces platform.
