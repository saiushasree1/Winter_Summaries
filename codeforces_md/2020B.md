The C++ code defines a program that solves a problem from Codeforces (problem 2020/B). The program consists of two functions: `solve()` and `main()`.

The `main()` function handles multiple test cases. It reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and then iterates `t` times, calling the `solve()` function for each test case.

The `solve()` function is where the core logic resides. It reads a single long long integer `k` from the input. It then calculates `k + int(sqrtl(k) + 0.5)` and prints the result to the console followed by a newline. The expression `int(sqrtl(k) + 0.5)` effectively calculates the integer part of the square root of `k`, rounded to the nearest integer.

In essence, for each test case, the program takes an input number `k`, adds the rounded integer part of its square root to it, and outputs the result.
