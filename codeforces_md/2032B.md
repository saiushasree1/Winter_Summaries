This C++ code solves a problem that likely involves finding a set of numbers that sum up to a target value, given constraints on the number of elements and the target.  The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads two integers, `n` and `k`.

The core logic handles three cases based on the relationship between `n` and `k`:

1. **`n == k` and `k == 1`:** If both `n` and `k` are 1, the output is 1 followed by 1 on a new line. This suggests a simple base case where a single element 1 is the solution.
2. **`n == k` or `k == 1` (excluding the previous case):** If `n` equals `k` but they are not both 1, or if `k` is 1 and `n` is not 1, the output is -1. This indicates that a solution is not possible under these conditions.
3. **Otherwise:** In all other cases, the output is 3, followed by a line containing three numbers. The specific numbers depend on whether `k-1` is even or odd:
   - If `(k-1) % 2 == 0`: The numbers are 1, `k-1`, and `k+2`.
   - If `(k-1) % 2 != 0`: The numbers are 1, `k`, and `k+1`.

The code likely generates a solution set of size 3 when a trivial solution or a solution with k=1 is not possible. The output 3 indicates the size of the generated set. The specific numbers are chosen based on `k` and an attempt to satisfy the problem's constraints. The use of the `bits/stdc++.h` header is a common practice in competitive programming for including all standard library headers.
