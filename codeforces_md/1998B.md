This C++ code solves a problem from Codeforces (1998B). The program first reads an integer `t`, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, indicating the size of an array. Then, it reads `n` integers into an array `a`. Finally, it prints the elements of the array `a` shifted cyclically to the left by one position. Specifically, the element at index `i` in the output is the element at index `(i+1)%n` in the input array. The elements are printed separated by spaces, followed by a newline. This process is repeated for all `t` test cases.
