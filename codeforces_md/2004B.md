The C++ code provided, likely for a competitive programming problem (indicated by the Codeforces URL), determines the number of points in the union of two intervals on a line, with special handling for shared endpoints.

The program starts by reading an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. It then iterates `t` times, processing each test case individually.

For each test case, the code reads two pairs of integers representing two intervals: `[l, r]` and `[li, ri]`. It ensures that the interval starting earlier is always the first interval by swapping them if necessary.

The core logic calculates the number of points in the union of these two intervals. It first checks if the intervals are completely disjoint (`r < li`). If they are, the union consists of the points in both intervals separately, and the code outputs `1` (this seems like a simplified output, perhaps based on the specific problem constraints, as the number of points would typically be `(r-l+1) + (ri-li+1)`).

If the intervals overlap or touch, the code calculates the size of their intersection. The intersection spans from the start of the later interval (`li`) to the end of the earlier interval's overlap with the later interval (`min(r, ri)`). The number of points in the union is derived from this intersection size.

The variable `c` is used to count shared endpoints. If the left endpoints are the same (`li == l`), `c` is incremented. If the right endpoints are the same (`r == ri`), `c` is also incremented. This `c` value is then subtracted from `min(r, ri) - li + 2` in the final calculation of the union size. This adjustment likely accounts for counting shared endpoints only once in the union.

Finally, the calculated number of points in the union is printed for each test case.

In summary, the code efficiently calculates the number of integer points in the union of two given intervals on a line, handling overlapping and disjoint cases, and adjusting for shared endpoints. The output for disjoint intervals appears simplified based on the context of the problem.
