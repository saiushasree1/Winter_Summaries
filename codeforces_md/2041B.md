The code reads an integer `t`, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two long long integers `w` and `b`. The goal is to find the largest integer `k` such that a sequence of length `k` can be formed using `w` white balls and `b` black balls, where the difference between the number of white balls and black balls in any prefix of the sequence is at most 1.

The code uses a binary search approach to find this largest `k`. It initializes `k` to the square root of `2 * (w + b)` as an initial guess. Then, it iteratively decreases `k` until the condition `k * (k + 1) <= 2 * (w + b)` and `max(w, b) >= k` is met, or `k` becomes 0. The condition `k * (k + 1) <= 2 * (w + b)` is derived from the fact that the minimum number of balls required to form a sequence of length `k` is `k * (k + 1) / 2` (alternating colors). The condition `max(w, b) >= k` ensures that there are enough balls of the majority color to support a sequence of length `k`. Finally, the code prints the found value of `k`.

In essence, the code solves a problem related to constructing a sequence of colored balls with a constraint on the color difference in prefixes, using a search approach to find the maximum possible sequence length.
