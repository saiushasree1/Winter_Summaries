The C++ code takes a string as input and attempts to find and print a substring of length 2 or 3 based on certain conditions.

**Functionality:**

The code iterates through a series of test cases. For each string input:

1. **Short Strings:** If the string length is 1 or the length is 2 with different characters, it prints "-1".
2. **Two Identical Characters:** If the string length is 2 and the characters are the same, it prints the string itself.
3. **Longer Strings:** For strings of length 3 or more:
   - It searches for the first occurrence of three consecutive characters that are all different. If found, it prints these three characters and stops searching.
   - If not found, it then searches for the first occurrence of two consecutive identical characters. If found, it prints these two characters and stops searching.
   - If neither of the above patterns is found in the initial loop, it checks the last two characters of the string. If they are identical, it prints them.
   - If none of the conditions are met, it prints "-1".

**Structure:**

- The code uses a `while` loop to handle multiple test cases.
- Inside the loop, it reads the string input.
- An `if-else if-else` structure handles the different string length conditions.
- A `for` loop is used to iterate through the string for patterns.
- A boolean flag `fl` is used to track if a pattern has been found and printed.

**Important Details:**

- The code prioritizes finding three distinct consecutive characters before looking for two identical ones.
- The check for two identical characters at the end of the string is performed only if no pattern is found in the initial loop.
- The problem seems to be related to Codeforces problem 2039/B, as indicated by the URL in the code snippet. This suggests the logic is designed to solve a specific problem constraint.

In essence, the code aims to extract the shortest possible substring (of length 2 or 3) that matches one of the specified patterns, with a preference for the three-distinct-character pattern. If no such pattern exists according to the rules, it outputs "-1".
